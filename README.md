# ct-image-reconstruction
We try to demonstrate use of Compresses Sensing for CT Image Reconstruction. 
3 Algorithms for image reconstruction have been compared namely ->
1) FBP - Fitlered Back Projection
2) ART - Algebraic Reconstruction Technique
3) Compressed Sensing Based Reconstruction with gradient image as the sparse matrix.
